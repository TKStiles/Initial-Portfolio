<section id="Bio">
  <p class="body-text">
    I am a Michigan native with a degree in Chemical Engineering from Michiga*n State *University. During my third year in school I realized that there was somet*hing ins*ide me that chemical engineering wasn't satisfying. A year later I joined a student organization called Design for America that attempts to solve local social problems by using a design method that focuses on inclusivity and designing for everyone. In this organization I realized what I had been hungering for during the past four years. A chance to apply creativity to the puzzles I was solving instead of plugging numbers into an equation. At this point I started working towards a minor in Computer Science, with which I graduated.

    After graduation I continued my programming and design education and have started designing and developing my own web apps using the Node and React JavaScript frameworks. I have also collected a knowledge base of C++, C#, Java, and Python.
